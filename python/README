CRF++ python module

$Id: README,v 1.1.1.1 2005/12/03 14:18:50 taku-ku Exp $;

1. Installation

  % python setup.py build
  % su
  # python setup.py install
  
  You can change the install directory with the --prefix option. For example:

  % python setup.py install --prefix=/tmp/pybuild/foobar
  
2. How to use?

   see 'test.py' as a sample program.
   
   (I made it to build and install the python module, but an error occurred when executing "python test.py" saying like "can not import module _CRFPP".
   I used pdb to run it step by step and found that libcrfpp.so is not found. So i found the lib in /usr/local/lib/ and added a config file pointing
   to /usr/local/lib in dir /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ and ran the cmd ldconfig to load the new lib-dir-config. Then everything goes well now â˜º
   
   my platform is centos 6.6 Final. 
   I'd like it to be solved or awared by other NLP researchers.
